2016 changes by Panjoo

- new normalmap
- model moved up and rescaled according to its world.cfg values
- model centered around origin

- made skin a little brighter as it was darker than the rest
- adjusted the view & link values to reposition and/or scale the model (this still needs tweaking)

(- added a 'dummy' world.cfg to make sure it wouldn't use the old cfg during testing)
