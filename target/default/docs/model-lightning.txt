2016 Changes by Panjoo

- new normalmap + skin_glow
- model moved up and rescaled according to its world.cfg values

- made skin darker (using the original psd) 
	- made skin less gritty/grungy so it looks more like smooth metal
	- changed some details
	- adjusted the view & link values to reposition and/or scale the model (this still needs tweaking)
