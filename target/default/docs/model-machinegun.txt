2016 Changes by Panjoo

- new normalmap
- model moved up and rescaled according to its world.cfg values
- fixed a hole in the model's barrel (vertexes in wrong order)

- adjusted the view & link values to reposition and/or scale the model (this still needs tweaking)

(- added a 'dummy' world.cfg to make sure it wouldn't use the old cfg during testing)
