2016 Changes by Panjoo

- designed new model from scratch
- designed new skin from scratch
- new normalmap + skin_glow

- adjusted the view & link values to reposition and/or scale the model (this still needs tweaking)

(- added a 'dummy' world.cfg to make sure it wouldn't use the old cfg during testing)
