2016 Changes by Panjoo

- new normalmap
- model moved up and rescaled according to its world.cfg values

- model looked weird in 1st person. Only thing that worked was completely do away with the upper part of the barrel top...
- which also meant a modified skin-mesh and a new skin altogether. 
- skin looked too sharp and gritty to resemble metal texture, this new one looks more metallic and shiny

- adjusted the view & link values to reposition and/or scale the model (this still needs tweaking)

(- added a 'dummy' world.cfg to make sure it wouldn't use the old cfg during testing)
