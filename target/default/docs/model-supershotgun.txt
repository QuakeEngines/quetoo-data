2016 Changes by Panjoo

- new normalmap
- model moved up and rescaled according to its world.cfg values

- this model had a few serious bugs and didn't seem to have been optimized at all (as for poly-saving and overlapping faces)
- made skin darker in some areas, especially the barrel

- adjusted the view & link values to reposition and/or scale the model (this still needs tweaking)

(- added a 'dummy' world.cfg to make sure it wouldn't use the old cfg during testing)
