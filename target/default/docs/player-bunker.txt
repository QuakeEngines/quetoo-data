Model description       	: 

A few of us here at Ritual thought it would be fun to see if we could do a quick Quake 3 model
that would relatively stay true to the specs of Quake 3. Problem is we never seem to have the time.
So we decided to challenge ourselves to get the skinning, animations, exportation and public
release all done in one day. We also thought it would be fun to give the public the opportunity
to participate. Hence the 24 hour Q3 challenge!


Dedication   		: We would like to dedicate this model to Kenneth Scott of id software.
	       		He is an inspiration to us all.

Thanks to              	 : Thanks to the entire modding community for making
			the 24 Hour Q3 Challenge so much fun!!!!!!!
