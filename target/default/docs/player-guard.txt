Model description       : 

	This is a Q3 version of my interpretation of a Quake 2 enemy: The (light) guard. The model (like virtually
	all my work), was made from scratch. It is dedicated to the joy that was, and is, Quake 2. This model is
	intended as an ode to the original, and not an attack or attempt to do anyone injustice. 


Add. Credits/Thanks     :

	id Software, for making the brilliant game that still inspires us to make cool stuff.
	
	To Good Old P. Steed, for his Thinking Outside of The Box, where I learnt my first basics on modelling and
	animating for Q3.

	Phoenix, for testing the model, and editing bots and a good set of sound-files.
	Scalliano, for making a good bot-base and thinking up many lines of cheesy bot-chat.
