Model description       : 

	This is the Q3 version of my interpretation of a Quake enemy: The Enforcer. It was made from scratch,
	and is an ODE to the original, not an attack or attempt to do injustice. Believe it or not, this fellow was
	my favourite enemy in that game :]


Add. Credits/Thanks     :
	
	To Good Old P. Steed, for sharing his .bip files. Couldn't have done the animation as 
	quickly or smoothly without 'em. Also, his Thinking Outside of The Box was great for refreshing
	that long-lost Physique knowledge ;]
