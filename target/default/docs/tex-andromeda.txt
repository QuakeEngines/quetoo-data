Instructions / INSTALLATION 

1. Extract the zip file in the BASEQ3 directory keeping the folder structure
(or just move it there and rename from .zip to pk3)
2. Goto the SCRIPTS sub-directory under the BASEQ3  and in the file SHADERLIST.TXT   
add the line at the bottom (the name of the .sahder) : andromeda


Please check all individual shaders for additional textures
because some light fixtures share the same blend texture.
